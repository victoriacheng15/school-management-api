# ðŸ§­ Learning Notes

Hereâ€™s a summary of what I learned while building this Flask API project.

---

## ðŸ§© Docker Multi-Stage Builds

**Context:** While containerizing my Flask API, I compared single-stage and multi-stage Docker builds to understand performance and image size differences.

**What I Learned:**

- Multi-stage builds produce smaller, cleaner images by separating build dependencies from the runtime environment.  
- The resulting image is more secure and efficient to deploy.  
- For small projects, build-time improvement is minor, but image size and maintainability improve significantly.  

**Why It Matters:**

- Reduces attack surface and unnecessary files in production images.  
- Optimizes CI/CD pipelines and deployment performance.  
- Encourages better separation of concerns between build and runtime stages.  

**How I Applied It:**

- Measured a single-stage build: ~1.67s build time.  
- Measured a multi-stage build: ~1.08s build time.  
- Verified that the multi-stage image excluded build tools and cached files, resulting in a smaller, more focused final image.  

**Challenges / Limitations:**

- Slightly more complex Dockerfile syntax to maintain.  
- Minimal build-time difference for small applications.

## ðŸ§© Archiving Data

**Context:** While designing the database schema, I explored how production systems manage and archive old or inactive data efficiently.

**What I Learned:**

- Archiving prevents large table growth and improves query performance.  
- Combining `updated_at` with a `status` column provides a reliable way to flag inactive records.  
- Archiving ensures compliance with data retention policies.  

**Why It Matters:**

- Keeps active tables lightweight and responsive.  
- Simplifies reporting by separating current vs. historical data.  
- Helps meet legal or organizational data retention requirements.  

**How I Applied It:**

- Added `is_archived`, `status`, and `updated_at` columns to relevant tables (e.g., `students`, `instructors`).  
- Defined logic to flag records as archived after inactivity (e.g., 1 year).  
- Ensured archived data remains accessible for compliance purposes.  

**Challenges / Limitations:**

- Requires additional maintenance scripts or cron jobs for automated archiving.  
- Queries must explicitly exclude archived records where appropriate.

## ðŸ§© Managing SQLite Database Connections

**Context:** While building the database layer, I investigated safe connection handling patterns for SQLite in API-based applications.

**What I Learned:**

- Closing the database connection after each operation prevents locks and memory issues.  
- Each API call should manage its own short-lived connection.  
- Persistent connections are better suited for larger systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL.  

**Why It Matters:**

- SQLite doesnâ€™t handle concurrent writes well, so keeping connections short-lived avoids contention.  
- Simplifies error recovery and ensures resources are released properly.  

**How I Applied It:**

- Wrapped every query execution in a `try-finally` block.  
- Ensured `self.close()` runs after `execute_query`, `execute_many`, and `execute_script` calls.  
- Verified stability by testing multiple API calls without connection leaks.  

**Challenges / Limitations:**

- Opening and closing connections frequently adds minimal overhead, but is acceptable for small apps.  
- Connection pooling isnâ€™t available by default in SQLite.

## ðŸ§© Python Decorators for Exception Handling

**Context:** To make route handlers cleaner and more consistent, I implemented custom decorators to handle exceptions across Flask routes.

**What I Learned:**

- Decorators can abstract repetitive logic such as exception handling, logging, and validation.  
- This pattern improves code maintainability and readability.  
- Centralized error handling helps return consistent API responses.  

**Why It Matters:**

- Reduces repetitive `try-except` blocks in every route.  
- Encourages consistent structure and reusable error patterns.  
- Easier to extend (e.g., add logging or authorization layers later).  

**How I Applied It:**

- Wrote decorators to catch `KeyError` and general exceptions.  
- Returned JSON responses with descriptive error messages and proper HTTP codes.  
- Applied the decorators across multiple route functions.  

**Challenges / Limitations:**

- Requires careful decorator ordering when stacking multiple decorators.  
- Must ensure wrapped functions preserve metadata (using `functools.wraps`).

- Python Docs: functools.wraps  
- Flask Patterns: Centralized Error Handling

## ðŸ§© The N+1 Problem in Bulk Operations

**Context:** While implementing bulk creation endpoints (students, instructors, courses), I encountered the N+1 query problem.

**What I Learned:**

- Executing inserts one-by-one in a loop causes unnecessary database roundtrips.  
- Batch operations improve efficiency, especially at scale.  
- SQLiteâ€™s `executemany()` supports batch inserts but lacks built-in ID retrieval for inserted rows.  

**Why It Matters:**

- Prevents performance bottlenecks during bulk API operations.  
- Enables faster and more scalable data ingestion in production systems.  

**How I Applied It:**

- Used simple one-by-one inserts for this learning project for simplicity.  
- Documented that batch inserts are the preferred pattern for production.  
- Planned a future refactor using `executemany()` plus an additional query to fetch inserted IDs.  

**Challenges / Limitations:**

- SQLite doesnâ€™t easily return multiple inserted IDs in batch mode.  
- Requires restructuring model/service layers to handle batch inserts cleanly.

- Python SQLite executemany Documentation  
- Articles on Solving the N+1 Query Problem

## ðŸ§  Summary

This project helped me deepen my understanding of containerization, database design, and backend engineering patterns. Each challengeâ€”from managing Docker builds to improving database logicâ€”reinforced how small architectural choices impact performance, maintainability, and scalability.
