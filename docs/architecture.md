# Architecture

## Overview

This project is a RESTful API built with Flask for managing a school database system. It supports typical operations like adding, updating, reading, and archiving entities such as students, instructors, departments, courses, and more.

The architecture follows a layered approach, separating routing, business logic, and database access.

## Technology Stack

- Flask – API framework
- PostgreSQL (Docker container) – Local development
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL – Cloud database (production)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR) – Container image storage (production)
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) – CI/CD artifact storage
- Azure Web App – Hosting containerized Flask API (production)
- Docker – Containerization
- Gunicorn – WSGI server
- GitHub Actions – CI for format, test, coverage, and markdown linting

## Key Components

- Client: Any tool or user agent—like Postman, curl, or a web browser—used to send HTTP requests to the API.
- Flask API Routes: Defines HTTP endpoints (e.g., /students, /courses) that handle requests, parse inputs, and send responses.
- Service Layer: Contains business logic such as data validation, processing rules, and orchestration between routes and the database layer.
- Database Layer: Responsible for executing raw SQL queries or ORM operations to interact with the PostgreSQL database (local via Docker Compose, production via Azure Database for PostgreSQL).
- PostgreSQL: The persistent database that stores all application data according to your defined schema. Local development uses Docker Compose, while production uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Flask as "Flask Route"
    participant Service as "StudentService"
    participant DB as "DB Layer"
    participant PostgreSQL as "PostgreSQL (Local/Azure)"

    Client->>Flask: POST /students
    Flask->>Service: validate & process data
    alt Data valid
        Service->>DB: insert student
        DB->>PostgreSQL: INSERT INTO students (...)
        PostgreSQL-->>DB: OK
        DB-->>Service: success
        Service-->>Flask: return 201 Created
        Flask-->>Client: 201 Created + JSON success response
    else Data invalid / error occurs
        Service-->>Flask: return error message + status code
        Flask-->>Client: Error response (400, 500, etc.) + JSON error message
    end
```

**Note**: This request flow pattern applies to all CRUD operations with the following variations:

**HTTP Methods and Endpoints:**

- `GET /students` (read all)
- `GET /students/{id}` (read by ID)
- `POST /students` (create)
- `PUT /students` (update)
- `PATCH /students` (archive/soft delete)

**SQL Operations:**

- `INSERT INTO students (...)` (create)
- `SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = ?` (read)
- `UPDATE students SET ... WHERE id = ?` (update/patch)

**Response Status Codes:**

- `201 Created` (POST - successful creation)
- `200 OK` (GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE - successful operations)
- `400 Bad Request` (invalid data or missing required fields)
- `404 Not Found` (when resource doesn't exist)
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` (archive operations when resource not found)
- `500 Internal Server Error` (unexpected server errors)

## Class Diagram (Generic)

This diagram illustrates the typical class structure and interactions for a single resource (e.g., "Assignment"). It shows how a request flows from the routing layer down to the database.

- **Route**: Handles HTTP requests, calls the appropriate service method, and formats the response. Maps to files in `app/routes/`.
- **Service**: Contains the core business logic and orchestrates data operations. Maps to files in `app/services/`.
- **Model**: Acts as a data access layer, directly responsible for database queries. Maps to files in `app/models/`.
- **DB**: A singleton class that manages the database connection pool and executes raw SQL queries. Maps to `db/database.py`.

    class Route {
        +GET /resource
        +GET /resource/(id)
        +POST /resource
        +PUT /resource
        +PATCH /resource
    }

    class Service {
        +get_all()
        +get_by_id(id)
        +create(data)
        +update(data)
        +archive(ids)
    }

    class Model {
        +read_all()
        +read_by_id(id)
        +read_by_ids(ids)
        +insert(data)
        +update(id, data)
        +archive(id)
    }

    class DB {
        +execute_query(query, params)
        +execute_many(query, param_list)
        +execute_script(script)
    }

    Route --|> Service : Calls
    Service --|> Model : Uses
    Model --|> DB : Executes queries via
```

## Deployment Architecture

This diagram illustrates the production infrastructure and the separation between local development and production environments.

    end

    Developer["Developer"] -->|Code Push| GHActions
    Developer -.->|Manual Build & Push| ACR
    Client["Client/API Consumer"] -->|HTTPS| WebApp
```

**Deployment Process:**

1. **Development**: Developers work locally with Flask API and PostgreSQL in Docker Compose
2. **CI/CD**: Code pushed to GitHub triggers automated format checks, tests, and coverage reporting via GitHub Actions
3. **Artifact Storage**: GitHub Actions builds Docker image and pushes to GHCR for CI/CD purposes
4. **Production Deployment** (Manual):
   - Docker image is manually built and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
   - Azure Web App pulls the image from ACR
   - Flask API runs in Azure Web App container with Gunicorn
   - API connects to Azure Database for PostgreSQL for data persistence
5. **Client Access**: External clients/applications access the API via HTTPS through Azure Web App

**Note**: Deployment to production is currently a manual process. GHCR serves as an artifact repository for CI/CD workflows but is not used for production deployments.
